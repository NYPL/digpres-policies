# NYPL Special Collections Portable Digital Storage Device Specification (Draft)
## Purpose
This specification covers the requirements for digital storage devices used to transport NYPLâ€™s digitized and born-digital special collections.

## Terminology
The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in [https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6120#ref-KEYWORDS](RFC 2119 KEYWORDS).

## Requirements
### Technology
Devices must be either hard disk drives (HDD) or solid state drives (SSD). Due to significant cost difference, HDD is recommended unless SSD is needed for performance reasons.

### Manufacturer
Devices may be any model number from any major manufacturer, except for those models listed in Appendix A.

As all manufacturing processes can be subject to systemic problems, occasional batches of specific model numbers will have high-failure rates. NYPL Digital Preservation will maintain and update a list of these model numbers in Appendix A.

Once a model number has been added to the list in Appendix A, any in-service device with that model number should be retired once its contents have been transferred.

### Enclosure
Devices must be enclosed and the enclosure must be made by one of the approved manufacturers listed in Appendix B.

Additions to this list must be approved by NYPL Digital Preservation.

### Capacity
Devices should be sized appropriately according to workflow and material stored. Projects are responsible for deciding what constitutes an appropriate size.

### Read Speed
Devices must provide at least 100 MB/sec sequential read speeds.
Devices must have a USB 3.0+ connection. Devices may have additional USB 3.0 and Thunderbolt connections.

### File System
Devices must be formatted as exFAT. For compatibility across operating systems, devices formatted as exFAT should use a maximum cluster size of 1024 bytes. Other file systems such as NTFS, HFS+, and AFS should not be used unless approved by NYPL Digital Preservation.

### Naming
Devices must have a unique identifier. The identifier must be printed on a physical label and securely attached to the enclosure. The same identifier must also be used as the device's volume label.

## Appendix A: Prohibited Model Numbers
Once a model number has been added to this listed, it must not be used for new purchases. Additionally, existing devices of that model number should be removed from service.

* Seagate ST4000DX000
* Toshiba DT01ACA300
* Western Digital WD20EFRX
* Western Digital WD60EFRX

## Appendix B: Approved Enclosure Manufacturers
The following is a list of approved enclosure manufacturers. Contact NYPL Digital Preservation to add new items to this list.

* Buffalo
* G-Technology
